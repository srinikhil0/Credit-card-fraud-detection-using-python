# Credit-card-fraud-detection-using-python

Hello Machile Learning and Data Science enthusiastics

This project is based upon the Credit card fraud detection.

The tools used are Jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebook is an editor for python code and widley used for data science.

Here we use various python libraries for analyzing the data and representing the pictorial representation of the data analyzed

The data set used in the alogorithm is: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

The data set is a csv file

The data set consits of 31 columns and more than 280k rows.

The columns are following:
1. Time: Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset
2. V1 to v28: These columns may be result of a PCA Dimensionality reduction to protect user identities and sensitive features(v1-v28)
3. Amount: Transaction amount
4. class: Class has only either 0 or 1 values. 1 for fraudulent transactions, 0 for legitimate transactions

To understand the source code see the source code file. Comments to the code added are understandable which code do what.
